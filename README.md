# Face Recognition Web App with Thermal Verification
## Face Detection on Raspberry Pi, Recognition on Remote Server and View On Web Application

Cloud based face recognition system using Raspberry Pi. I have used Flask as my backend and deepface library for face embeddings and detection.

## Raspberry Pi

I used official PiCam v2 NoIR camera with picamera2 python library. For thermal camera I used mlx9060 with adafruit libraries.
